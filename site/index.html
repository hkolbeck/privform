    <div id="explanation">
        PrivForm.net uses a technology called <i>asymmetric encryption</i> (PGP to be exact) to ensure that the
        responses to your forms are only unencrypted when your respondents enter them and when you read them. When
        you're setting up a form you'll generate a <i>keypair</i>, a private key and a public key. You'll save the
        private key file to your computer and send us the public key. When people respond, their responses will be
        encrypted with the public key before they're sent over the internet to us, and only the private key that's never
        been seen by anyone but you can unencrypt them. For details, please check out the README on Github, linked in
        lower right corner.
